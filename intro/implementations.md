## Other Implementations of Ruby[](#other-implementations-of-ruby)

Ruby, as a language, has a few different implementations. This page has
been discussing the reference implementation, in the community often
referred to as **MRI** (“Matz’s Ruby Interpreter”) or **CRuby** (since
it is written in C), but there are also others. They are often useful in
certain situations, provide extra integration to other languages or
environments, or have special features that MRI doesn’t.

Here’s a list:

* <a href='http://jruby.org' class='remote' target='_blank'>JRuby</a> is
  Ruby atop the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), utilizing the JVM’s
  optimizing JIT compilers, garbage collectors, concurrent threads, tool
  ecosystem, and vast collection of libraries.
* <a href='http://rubini.us' class='remote' target='_blank'>Rubinius</a>
  is ‘Ruby written in Ruby’. Built on top of LLVM, Rubinius sports a
  nifty virtual machine that other languages are being built on top of,
  too.
* <a href='https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby' class='remote'
  target='_blank'>TruffleRuby</a> is a high performance Ruby
  implementation on top of GraalVM.
* <a href='http://www.mruby.org/' class='remote'
  target='_blank'>mruby</a> is a lightweight implementation of the Ruby
  language that can be linked and embedded within an application. Its
  development is led by Ruby’s creator Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto.
* <a href='http://www.ironruby.net' class='remote'
  target='_blank'>IronRuby</a> is an implementation “tightly integrated
  with the .NET Framework”.
* <a href='http://maglev.github.io' class='remote'
  target='_blank'>MagLev</a> is “a fast, stable, Ruby implementation
  with integrated object persistence and distributed shared cache”.
* <a href='https://github.com/parrot/cardinal' class='remote'
  target='_blank'>Cardinal</a> is a “Ruby compiler for <a
  href='http://parrot.org' class='remote' target='_blank'>Parrot</a>
  Virtual Machine” (Perl 6).
