## Net::IMAP[](#netimap)

Net::IMAP implements Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) client functionality.

### IMAP Overview[](#imap-overview)

An IMAP client connects to a server, and then authenticates itself using either `#authenticate`() or `#login`(). Having authenticated itself, there is a range of commands available to it. Most work with mailboxes, which may be arranged in an hierarchical namespace, and each of which contains zero or more messages. How this is implemented on the server is implementation-dependent; on a UNIX server, it will frequently be implemented as files in mailbox format within a hierarchy of directories.

To work on the messages within a mailbox, the client must first select that mailbox, using either `#select`() or (for read-only access) `#examine`(). Once the client has successfully selected a mailbox, they enter *selected* state, and that mailbox becomes the *current* mailbox, on which mail-item related commands implicitly operate.

Messages have two sorts of identifiers: message sequence numbers and UIDs.

Message sequence numbers number messages within a mailbox from 1 up to the number of items in the mailbox. If a new message arrives during a session, it receives a sequence number equal to the new size of the mailbox. If messages are expunged from the mailbox, remaining messages have their sequence numbers "shuffled down" to fill the gaps.

UIDs, on the other hand, are permanently guaranteed not to identify another message within the same mailbox, even if the existing message is deleted. UIDs are required to be assigned in ascending (but not necessarily sequential) order within a mailbox; this means that if a non-IMAP client rearranges the order of mailitems within a mailbox, the UIDs have to be reassigned. An IMAP client thus cannot rearrange message orders.

### Examples of Usage[](#examples-of-usage)

#### List sender and subject of all recent messages in the default mailbox[](#list-sender-and-subject-of-all-recent-messages-in-the-default-mailbox)


```ruby
imap = Net::IMAP.new('mail.example.com')
imap.authenticate('LOGIN', 'joe_user', 'joes_password')
imap.examine('INBOX')
imap.search(["RECENT"]).each do |message_id|
  envelope = imap.fetch(message_id, "ENVELOPE")[0].attr["ENVELOPE"]
  puts "#{envelope.from[0].name}: \t#{envelope.subject}"
end
```

#### Move all messages from April 2003 from "Mail/sent-mail" to "Mail/sent-apr03"[](#move-all-messages-from-april-2003-from-mailsent-mail-to-mailsent-apr03)


```ruby
imap = Net::IMAP.new('mail.example.com')
imap.authenticate('LOGIN', 'joe_user', 'joes_password')
imap.select('Mail/sent-mail')
if not imap.list('Mail/', 'sent-apr03')
  imap.create('Mail/sent-apr03')
end
imap.search(["BEFORE", "30-Apr-2003", "SINCE", "1-Apr-2003"]).each do |message_id|
  imap.copy(message_id, "Mail/sent-apr03")
  imap.store(message_id, "+FLAGS", [:Deleted])
end
imap.expunge
```

### Thread Safety[](#thread-safety)

Net::IMAP supports concurrent threads. For example,


```ruby
imap = Net::IMAP.new("imap.foo.net", "imap2")
imap.authenticate("cram-md5", "bar", "password")
imap.select("inbox")
fetch_thread = Thread.start { imap.fetch(1..-1, "UID") }
search_result = imap.search(["BODY", "hello"])
fetch_result = fetch_thread.value
imap.disconnect
```

This script invokes the FETCH command and the SEARCH command concurrently.
