# Arguments and Enviroment

Ruby core provides several contants for access to a command's arguments and environment:

* `ARGV`: Array of command-line arguments;
* `ARGF`: IO-like object for reading from file arguments;
* `ENV`: Hash-like object for access to environment variables.

See also [optparse](stdlib/cli/optparse.md) standard library for declaring and parsing command-line arguments as options.
