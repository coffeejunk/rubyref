## Comments as documentation

The Ruby standard library includes the [RDoc](developing/documenting.md) tool for generating documentation from code. RDoc format is "unobtrusive" (plain text) documentation. Ruby gem [YARD](https://yardoc.org/) is also frequently used to generate documentation, providing a more strict format allowing rendering of "tags" (param types, return type, examples and so on).
