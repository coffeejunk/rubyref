# Ruby Code Style

There is no single preferred or enforced style for Ruby code. Several community or privately authored style guides exist, the most widely adopted is [The Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/).

The popular [rubocop](http://rubocop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) code analyzer and linter is by default set to the rules of this guide. Rubocop is flexible enough to support any style guide, and it is common to change the `.rubocop.yml` with alternative style guides.
