# The Ruby Reference

<a href='https://www.patreon.com/zverok' target='_blank'><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/patreon-donate-blue.svg" alt="Patreon"/></a>

This book is a reference for the [Ruby programming language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/). It describes the language structure, its core classes and standard library, and provides some additional useful information and links for Ruby development.

The Reference is intended to be always up-to-date with the current Ruby version.

Most of the reference content is taken directly from [Ruby documentation](https://ruby-doc.org) and reorganized for easier reading. The core docs were augmented with some quotes from the [Ruby website](https://ruby-lang.org), and some missing content that is written specifically for the book. The source of the book (rendering scripts, config, and unique content) can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/rubyreferences/rubyref/tree/master/_src).

Happy Hacking!
