# ConditionVariable

ConditionVariable objects augment class Mutex. Using condition variables, it
is possible to suspend while in the middle of a critical section until a
resource becomes available.

Example:

    mutex = Mutex.new
    resource = ConditionVariable.new

    a = Thread.new {
       mutex.synchronize {
         # Thread 'a' now needs the resource
         resource.wait(mutex)
         # 'a' can now have the resource
       }
    }

    b = Thread.new {
       mutex.synchronize {
         # Thread 'b' has finished using the resource
         resource.signal
       }
    }
