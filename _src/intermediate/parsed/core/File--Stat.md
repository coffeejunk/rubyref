# File::Stat

Objects of class File::Stat encapsulate common status information for File
objects. The information is recorded at the moment the File::Stat object is
created; changes made to the file after that point will not be reflected.
File::Stat objects are returned by IO#stat, File::stat, File#lstat, and
File::lstat. Many of these methods return platform-specific values, and not
all values are meaningful on all systems. See also Kernel#test.
