# Complex

A complex number can be represented as a paired real number with imaginary
unit; a+bi.  Where a is real part, b is imaginary part and i is imaginary
unit.  Real a equals complex a+0i mathematically.

Complex object can be created as literal, and also by using Kernel#Complex,
Complex::rect, Complex::polar or to_c method.

    2+1i                 #=> (2+1i)
    Complex(1)           #=> (1+0i)
    Complex(2, 3)        #=> (2+3i)
    Complex.polar(2, 3)  #=> (-1.9799849932008908+0.2822400161197344i)
    3.to_c               #=> (3+0i)

You can also create complex object from floating-point numbers or strings.

    Complex(0.3)         #=> (0.3+0i)
    Complex('0.3-0.5i')  #=> (0.3-0.5i)
    Complex('2/3+3/4i')  #=> ((2/3)+(3/4)*i)
    Complex('1@2')       #=> (-0.4161468365471424+0.9092974268256817i)

    0.3.to_c             #=> (0.3+0i)
    '0.3-0.5i'.to_c      #=> (0.3-0.5i)
    '2/3+3/4i'.to_c      #=> ((2/3)+(3/4)*i)
    '1@2'.to_c           #=> (-0.4161468365471424+0.9092974268256817i)

A complex object is either an exact or an inexact number.

    Complex(1, 1) / 2    #=> ((1/2)+(1/2)*i)
    Complex(1, 1) / 2.0  #=> (0.5+0.5i)
