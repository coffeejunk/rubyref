# Hash

A Hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. Also
called associative arrays, they are similar to Arrays, but where an Array uses
integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object type.

Hashes enumerate their values in the order that the corresponding keys were
inserted.

A Hash can be easily created by using its implicit form:

    grades = { "Jane Doe" => 10, "Jim Doe" => 6 }

Hashes allow an alternate syntax for keys that are symbols. Instead of

    options = { :font_size => 10, :font_family => "Arial" }

You could write it as:

    options = { font_size: 10, font_family: "Arial" }

Each named key is a symbol you can access in hash:

    options[:font_size]  # => 10

A Hash can also be created through its ::new method:

    grades = Hash.new
    grades["Dorothy Doe"] = 9

Hashes have a *default value* that is returned when accessing keys that do not
exist in the hash. If no default is set `nil` is used. You can set the default
value by sending it as an argument to Hash.new:

    grades = Hash.new(0)

Or by using the #default= method:

    grades = {"Timmy Doe" => 8}
    grades.default = 0

Accessing a value in a Hash requires using its key:

    puts grades["Jane Doe"] # => 0

### Common Uses

Hashes are an easy way to represent data structures, such as

    books         = {}
    books[:matz]  = "The Ruby Programming Language"
    books[:black] = "The Well-Grounded Rubyist"

Hashes are also commonly used as a way to have named parameters in functions.
Note that no brackets are used below. If a hash is the last argument on a
method call, no braces are needed, thus creating a really clean interface:

    Person.create(name: "John Doe", age: 27)

    def self.create(params)
      @name = params[:name]
      @age  = params[:age]
    end

### Hash Keys

Two objects refer to the same hash key when their `hash` value is identical
and the two objects are `eql?` to each other.

A user-defined class may be used as a hash key if the `hash` and `eql?`
methods are overridden to provide meaningful behavior.  By default, separate
instances refer to separate hash keys.

A typical implementation of `hash` is based on the object's data while `eql?`
is usually aliased to the overridden `==` method:

    class Book
      attr_reader :author, :title

      def initialize(author, title)
        @author = author
        @title = title
      end

      def ==(other)
        self.class === other and
          other.author == @author and
          other.title == @title
      end

      alias eql? ==

      def hash
        @author.hash ^ @title.hash # XOR
      end
    end

    book1 = Book.new 'matz', 'Ruby in a Nutshell'
    book2 = Book.new 'matz', 'Ruby in a Nutshell'

    reviews = {}

    reviews[book1] = 'Great reference!'
    reviews[book2] = 'Nice and compact!'

    reviews.length #=> 1
