# RubyVM

The RubyVM module only exists on MRI. `RubyVM` is not defined in other Ruby
implementations such as JRuby and TruffleRuby.

The RubyVM module provides some access to MRI internals. This module is for
very limited purposes, such as debugging, prototyping, and research.  Normal
users must not use it. This module is not portable between Ruby
implementations.
