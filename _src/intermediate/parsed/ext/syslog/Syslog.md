# Syslog

The syslog package provides a Ruby interface to the POSIX system logging
facility.

Syslog messages are typically passed to a central logging daemon. The daemon
may filter them; route them into different files (usually found under
/var/log); place them in SQL databases; forward them to centralized logging
servers via TCP or UDP; or even alert the system administrator via email,
pager or text message.

Unlike application-level logging via Logger or Log4r, syslog is designed to
allow secure tamper-proof logging.

The syslog protocol is standardized in RFC 5424.
