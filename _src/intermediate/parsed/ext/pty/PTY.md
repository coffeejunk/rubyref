# PTY

Creates and manages pseudo terminals (PTYs).  See also
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo_terminal

PTY allows you to allocate new terminals using ::open or ::spawn a new
terminal with a specific command.

## Example

In this example we will change the buffering type in the `factor` command,
assuming that factor uses stdio for stdout buffering.

If IO.pipe is used instead of PTY.open, this code deadlocks because factor's
stdout is fully buffered.

    # start by requiring the standard library PTY
    require 'pty'

    master, slave = PTY.open
    read, write = IO.pipe
    pid = spawn("factor", :in=>read, :out=>slave)
    read.close     # we dont need the read
    slave.close    # or the slave

    # pipe "42" to the factor command
    write.puts "42"
    # output the response from factor
    p master.gets #=> "42: 2 3 7\n"

    # pipe "144" to factor and print out the response
    write.puts "144"
    p master.gets #=> "144: 2 2 2 2 3 3\n"
    write.close # close the pipe

    # The result of read operation when pty slave is closed is platform
    # dependent.
    ret = begin
            master.gets     # FreeBSD returns nil.
          rescue Errno::EIO # GNU/Linux raises EIO.
            nil
          end
    p ret #=> nil
