## Execution Flow

* [abort](ref:Kernel#abort): 
* [at_exit](ref:Kernel#at_exit): Converts *block* to a `Proc` object (and therefore binds it at the point of call) and registers it for execution when the program exits.
* [exit](ref:Kernel#exit): Initiates the termination of the Ruby script by raising the SystemExit exception.
* [exit!](ref:Kernel#exit!): Exits the process immediately.
* [catch](ref:Kernel#catch): `catch` executes its block.
* [throw](ref:Kernel#throw): Transfers control to the end of the active `catch` block waiting for *tag*.
* [fail](ref:Kernel#fail): With no arguments, raises the exception in `$!` or raises a RuntimeError if `$!` is `nil`.
* [raise](ref:Kernel#raise): With no arguments, raises the exception in `$!` or raises a RuntimeError if `$!` is `nil`.
* [loop](ref:Kernel#loop): Repeatedly executes the block.
* [sleep](ref:Kernel#sleep): Suspends the current thread for *duration* seconds (which may be any number, including a `Float` with fractional seconds).

## IO and Strings

* [gets](ref:Kernel#gets): Returns (and assigns to `$_`) the next line from the list of files in `ARGV` (or `$*`), or from standard input if no files are present on the command line.
* [format](ref:Kernel#format): Returns the string resulting from applying *format_string* to any additional arguments.
* [p](ref:Kernel#p): For each object, directly writes *obj*.`inspect` followed by a newline to the program's standard output.
* [print](ref:Kernel#print): Prints each object in turn to `$stdout`.
* [printf](ref:Kernel#printf): Equivalent to:     io.write(sprintf(string, obj, ...))  or     $stdout.write(sprintf(string, obj, ...))
* [putc](ref:Kernel#putc): Equivalent to:      $stdout.putc(int)  Refer to the documentation for IO#putc for important information regarding multi-byte characters.
* [puts](ref:Kernel#puts): Equivalent to      $stdout.puts(obj, ...)
* [readline](ref:Kernel#readline): Equivalent to Kernel::gets, except `readline` raises `EOFError` at end of file.
* [readlines](ref:Kernel#readlines): Returns an array containing the lines returned by calling `Kernel.gets(*sep*)` until the end of file.
* [sprintf](ref:Kernel#sprintf): Returns the string resulting from applying *format_string* to any additional arguments.

## Files

* [open](ref:Kernel#open): Creates an IO object connected to the given stream, file, or subprocess.
* [select](ref:Kernel#select): Calls select(2) system call.
* [test](ref:Kernel#test): Uses the character `cmd` to perform various tests on `file1` (first table below) or on `file1` and `file2` (second table).

## Tracing Execution

* [set_trace_func](ref:Kernel#set_trace_func): Establishes *proc* as the handler for tracing, or disables tracing if the parameter is `nil`.
* [trace_var](ref:Kernel#trace_var): Controls tracing of assignments to global variables.
* [untrace_var](ref:Kernel#untrace_var): Removes tracing for the specified command on the given global variable and returns `nil`.

## Processes and Commands
