# File::Constants

Document-module: File::Constants

File::Constants provides file-related constants.  All possible file constants
are listed in the documentation but they may not all be present on your
platform.

If the underlying platform doesn't define a constant the corresponding Ruby
constant is not defined.

Your platform documentations (e.g. man open(2)) may describe more detailed
information.
