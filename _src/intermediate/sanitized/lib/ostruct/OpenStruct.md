# OpenStruct

An OpenStruct is a data structure, similar to a Hash, that allows the
definition of arbitrary attributes with their accompanying values. This is
accomplished by using Ruby's metaprogramming to define methods on the class
itself.

## Examples

    require "ostruct"

    person = OpenStruct.new
    person.name = "John Smith"
    person.age  = 70

    person.name      # => "John Smith"
    person.age       # => 70
    person.address   # => nil

An OpenStruct employs a Hash internally to store the attributes and values and
can even be initialized with one:

    australia = OpenStruct.new(:country => "Australia", :capital => "Canberra")
      # => #<OpenStruct country="Australia", capital="Canberra">

Hash keys with spaces or characters that could normally not be used for method
calls (e.g. `()[]*`) will not be immediately available on the OpenStruct
object as a method for retrieval or assignment, but can still be reached
through the `Object#send` method.

    measurements = OpenStruct.new("length (in inches)" => 24)
    measurements.send("length (in inches)")   # => 24

    message = OpenStruct.new(:queued? => true)
    message.queued?                           # => true
    message.send("queued?=", false)
    message.queued?                           # => false

Removing the presence of an attribute requires the execution of the
delete_field method as setting the property value to `nil` will not remove the
attribute.

    first_pet  = OpenStruct.new(:name => "Rowdy", :owner => "John Smith")
    second_pet = OpenStruct.new(:name => "Rowdy")

    first_pet.owner = nil
    first_pet                 # => #<OpenStruct name="Rowdy", owner=nil>
    first_pet == second_pet   # => false

    first_pet.delete_field(:owner)
    first_pet                 # => #<OpenStruct name="Rowdy">
    first_pet == second_pet   # => true

## Implementation

An OpenStruct utilizes Ruby's method lookup structure to find and define the
necessary methods for properties. This is accomplished through the methods
method_missing and define_singleton_method.

This should be a consideration if there is a concern about the performance of
the objects that are created, as there is much more overhead in the setting of
these properties compared to using a Hash or a Struct.
