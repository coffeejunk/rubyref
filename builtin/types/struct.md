## Struct[](#struct)

A Struct is a convenient way to bundle a number of attributes together, using accessor methods, without having to write an explicit class.

The Struct class generates new subclasses that hold a set of members and their values. For each member a reader and writer method is created similar to `Module#attr_accessor`.


```ruby
Customer = Struct.new(:name, :address) do
  def greeting
    "Hello #{name}!"
  end
end

dave = Customer.new("Dave", "123 Main")
dave.name     #=> "Dave"
dave.greeting #=> "Hello Dave!"
```

See Struct::new for further examples of creating struct subclasses and instances.

In the method descriptions that follow, a "member" parameter refers to a struct member which is either a quoted string (`"name"`) or a Symbol (`:name`).

### OpenStruct[](#openstruct)

*Part of standard library. You need to `require 'ostruct'` before using.*

An OpenStruct is a data structure, similar to a Hash, that allows the definition of arbitrary attributes with their accompanying values. This is accomplished by using Ruby's metaprogramming to define methods on the class itself.

#### Examples[](#examples)


```ruby
require "ostruct"

person = OpenStruct.new
person.name = "John Smith"
person.age  = 70

person.name      # => "John Smith"
person.age       # => 70
person.address   # => nil
```

An OpenStruct employs a Hash internally to store the attributes and values and can even be initialized with one:


```ruby
australia = OpenStruct.new(:country => "Australia", :capital => "Canberra")
  # => #<OpenStruct country="Australia", capital="Canberra">
```

Hash keys with spaces or characters that could normally not be used for method calls (e.g. `()[]*`) will not be immediately available on the OpenStruct object as a method for retrieval or assignment, but can still be reached through the `Object#send` method.


```ruby
measurements = OpenStruct.new("length (in inches)" => 24)
measurements.send("length (in inches)")   # => 24

message = OpenStruct.new(:queued? => true)
message.queued?                           # => true
message.send("queued?=", false)
message.queued?                           # => false
```

Removing the presence of an attribute requires the execution of the delete\_field method as setting the property value to `nil` will not remove the attribute.


```ruby
first_pet  = OpenStruct.new(:name => "Rowdy", :owner => "John Smith")
second_pet = OpenStruct.new(:name => "Rowdy")

first_pet.owner = nil
first_pet                 # => #<OpenStruct name="Rowdy", owner=nil>
first_pet == second_pet   # => false

first_pet.delete_field(:owner)
first_pet                 # => #<OpenStruct name="Rowdy">
first_pet == second_pet   # => true
```

#### Implementation[](#implementation)

An OpenStruct utilizes Ruby's method lookup structure to find and define the necessary methods for properties. This is accomplished through the methods method\_missing and define\_singleton\_method.

This should be a consideration if there is a concern about the performance of the objects that are created, as there is much more overhead in the setting of these properties compared to using a Hash or a Struct.
