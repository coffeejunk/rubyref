## Module[](#module)

A Module is a collection of methods and constants. The methods in a module may be instance methods or module methods. Instance methods appear as methods in a class when the module is included, module methods do not. Conversely, module methods may be called without creating an encapsulating object, while instance methods may not. (See `Module#module_function`.)

In the descriptions that follow, the parameter *sym* refers to a symbol, which is either a quoted string or a Symbol (such as `:name`).


```ruby
module Mod
  include Math
  CONST = 1
  def meth
    #  ...
  end
end
Mod.class              #=> Module
Mod.constants          #=> [:CONST, :PI, :E]
Mod.instance_methods   #=> [:meth]
```

### Class[](#class)

Classes in Ruby are first-class objectsâ€”each is an instance of class Class.

Typically, you create a new class by using:


```ruby
class Name
 # some code describing the class behavior
end
```

When a new class is created, an object of type Class is initialized and assigned to a global constant (Name in this case).

When `Name.new` is called to create a new object, the `#new` method in Class is run by default. This can be demonstrated by overriding `#new` in Class:


```ruby
class Class
  alias old_new new
  def new(*args)
    print "Creating a new ", self.name, "\n"
    old_new(*args)
  end
end

class Name
end

n = Name.new
```

*produces:*


```ruby
Creating a new Name
```

Classes, modules, and objects are interrelated. In the diagram that follows, the vertical arrows represent inheritance, and the parentheses metaclasses. All metaclasses are instances of the class `Class`.
