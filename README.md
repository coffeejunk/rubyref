## The Ruby Reference[](#the-ruby-reference)

<a href="https://www.patreon.com/zverok" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/patreon-donate-blue.svg" alt="Patreon" /></a>

This book is a reference for the <a href='https://www.ruby-lang.org/' class='remote' target='_blank'>Ruby programming language</a>. It describes the language structure, its core classes and standard library, and provides some additional useful information and links for Ruby development.

The Reference is intended to be always up-to-date with the current Ruby version.

Most of the reference content is taken directly from <a href='https://ruby-doc.org' class='ruby-doc remote' target='_blank'>Ruby documentation</a> and reorganized for easier reading. The core docs were augmented with some quotes from the <a href='https://ruby-lang.org' class='remote' target='_blank'>Ruby website</a>, and some missing content that is written specifically for the book. The source of the book (rendering scripts, config, and unique content) can be found at <a href='https://github.com/rubyreferences/rubyref/tree/master/_src' class='remote' target='_blank'>GitHub</a>.

Happy Hacking!
