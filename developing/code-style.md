## Ruby Code Style[](#ruby-code-style)

There is no single preferred or enforced style for Ruby code. Several community or privately authored style guides exist, the most widely adopted is <a href='https://rubystyle.guide/' class='remote' target='_blank'>The Ruby Style Guide</a>.

The popular <a href='http://rubocop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/' class='remote' target='_blank'>rubocop</a> code analyzer and linter is by default set to the rules of this guide. Rubocop is flexible enough to support any style guide, and it is common to change the `.rubocop.yml` with alternative style guides.
