## Testing Ruby Code[](#testing-ruby-code)

Recent Ruby versions come with *bundled gem* for testing, named <a href='https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest' class='remote' target='_blank'>minitest</a>. It provides a complete suite of testing facilities supporting TDD, BDD, mocking, and benchmarking.

Example of unit test with minitest, taken from its README:


```ruby
require "minitest/autorun"

class TestMeme < Minitest::Test
  def setup
    @meme = Meme.new
  end

  def test_that_kitty_can_eat
    assert_equal "OHAI!", @meme.i_can_has_cheezburger?
  end

  def test_that_it_will_not_blend
    refute_match /^no/i, @meme.will_it_blend?
  end

  def test_that_will_be_skipped
    skip "test this later"
  end
end
```

Another widely popular library for testing is <a href='http://rspec.info/' class='remote' target='_blank'>RSpec</a>. Here is example of its syntax, take from the README:


```ruby
RSpec.describe Bowling, "#score" do
  context "with no strikes or spares" do
    it "sums the pin count for each pin" do
      bowling = Bowling.new
      20.times { bowling.hit(4) }
      expect(bowling.score).to eq 80
    end
  end
end
```

> *Note*\: Minitest also supports RSpec-like syntax via `minitest/spec`.
